The explosion in information technology, and the rapid expansion in all domains of
science since the industrial revolution, now greatly amplified with the invention
of the Web, is entailing a rapid acceleration and growth and forces us to deploy a large spectrum of methods, and mastering a significant number of skills in order to cope up with such development.  

Therefore, I assert that one should focus on self-improvement, on both the intellectual and physical levels, including the setup and evolution of an open mindset.

Mastery should be achieved in all of these domains :

* Mathematics : Abstract Mathematics, Applied Analysis, Mathematics for Quantum Mechanics, Axiomatic Set Theory, Model Theory and Mathematical Modeling.
* Physics : Enhanced understanding of the laws that governs our universe, starting from
electromagnetism, mechanics, to Quantum Electro-dynamics, Quantum Chromo-dynamics, Quantum Field Theory.
* Computer Science, Deep Learning, Architecture of computer systems, Linux Operating System inner workings, Software engineering, real-time operating systems.
* Programming : Complete Mastery over C\C++ language, HTML, CSS, Bash, X86 Assembly, LaTeX.
* Electronics, Microelectronics, passive and active hyperfrequency circuits, semiconductor physics, CMOS transistor technology.
* Micrcontrollers programming, such as the STM32F4 (ARM Cortex-M4).
* Drone system architectures, PX4 software, NuttX RTOS.
* Nanotechnology.
* Brain anatomy and Neuroscience.
* Advanced understanding of Computer Algorithms.

Such Mastery will allow us to deploy large amounts of new tactics in dealing with real world
problems.

A reading list has been [deployed](https://mhageh.github.io/thoughts/2017/05/09/reading-list.html), and one should stick to it and the requirements described in order to achieve such fate.

Current spectrum of skills (not close to full mastery by any means).
* Programming : C\C++, Python, HTML, CSS(beginner), LaTeX.
* Microelectronics, CMOS technology, Analysis and design of microelectronics projects.
* Active and Passive Hyperfrequency circuits.
* Drones, quadcopters, PX4 system, NuttX RTOS.
* Linux inner workings and system security, administration.
* Emacs, Git.
* Mathematics : Axiomatic Set Theory (ZFC).
* Physics : Electromagnetism.
* Electronics, circuit theory, circuit design.

Looking forward to :
