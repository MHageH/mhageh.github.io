Our world seems to undergo many changes in the last centuries : since the industrial revolution, technology was shaping the form of society to come. It’s to be noted that not only technology, but the flow of thoughts in general, that was the leading force behind this movement across Europe.  
This flow was led by very intelligent agents in different sectors, especially the scientific ones, like physics, mathematics, chemistry, biology, avionics, let not alone the economic field. The evolution of this phenomena, had a beneficial effect on the society : it led to a positive social state that adhere to the continuous scientific improvement of the community, and laid down the building blocks for different philosophies to emerge as a result.    
The period between 1850 and 1950 saw the rise of mastermind groups with different doctrines, like the Communist movement, the German Nazi one, and several hidden key elements that shaped the face of Europe during the two world wars.  
These forces shifted and changed faces many times, and even new ones emerged. The continuous integration of elements of these groups into the governments, shaped the general strategy and “laws of conduct” of several countries over the last decades, and became the main centers of decision.  
In thought groups, or in “Think Tanks”, critical decisions are made on the geopolitical and economical levels to confront all major challenges a country can face in the future. The anatomy of think tanks consists on acquiring all the necessary information by different means, even by intelligence agents, analyze and deploy strategies on a large scale to sustain the lead advantage in the global community.    
The Arabic world’s lack of think tanks, as well as a public conscience on the dangers of internal and external threats, is the main reason behind the ongoing total dissolution of the these nations.
Unable to face the immediate threat posed by important regional powers, as well as other key factors in the region, have left the Arabic states without any kind of defense against the imposed global strategies by foreign countries.
